	CU@MyPlace is a Hotel Management System that focuses on many general aspects of hotel management such as payment management, staff management, room management and service management. The project will try to use the idea of Relational Database to create the database that could support the system. The project is developed using PHP with mySQL in order to create Web Application that could show General Information about the hotel, Customer System that allows customer to book room and do several functions and Administration System that allows staffs to do management functions. This project simplifies complicating jobs of hotel management into simpler idea that allows us to focus on studying database and system development. Our approach to create this system will involve iterative processes of creating ER Diagrams, creating DataFlow Diagram and creating Context Diagram in order to decide the functions of the database and will be shown more in detail later in this report.
